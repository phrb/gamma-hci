## Setting Up pyQt4 in Debian:

Simple steps to setup a minimal
development environment for our
project:

Make sure you have all the tools:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

Then, install pyQt4:

    $ sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools

Then QtDesigner to speed things up (allegedly):

    $ sudo apt-get install qt4-designer
